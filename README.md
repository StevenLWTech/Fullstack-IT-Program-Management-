# Fullstack IT Programs Search and Filter with CRUD

## Description

IT-Program-Management is a comprehensive web application designed to showcase IT programs offered by local community colleges in Washington State. With a user-friendly interface, this platform empowers prospective IT students to efficiently search and filter through a wide range of programs. The primary objective of this project is to simplify the program selection process for potential IT students by offering a centralized and easily navigable database of IT programs.

In addition to its student-centric features, IT-Program-Management also includes an administrative panel accessible via the "/admin" route.

By combining cutting-edge technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, React.js, and utilizing JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and MDN Bootstrap, IT-Program-Management emerges as a full-stack solution, encompassing both server-side and client-side aspects. This holistic approach ensures a robust and efficient application that meets the diverse needs of prospective IT students and streamlines administrative operations.

IT-Program-Management serves as a reliable and efficient tool for individuals seeking IT education in Washington State, facilitating their journey towards finding the most suitable IT program while offering administrators a convenient platform to manage program information effectively.
